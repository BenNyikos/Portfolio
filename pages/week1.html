    <h2>Module summary</h2>
    <p>
      During the first module we went through the introduction, how the class
      gonna look like, etc.
      <br />
      We also learned about how internet works in basic terms e.g.:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>IP addresses, like Localhost(127.0.0.1), Google DNS, Internal IP</li>
      <li>
        Ports, which are identify specific processes or types of network
        services
      </li>
      <li>Protocols, like HTTP, HTTPS, DNS, etc.</li>
      <li>
        HTTP = HyperText Tranfer Protocol communication between user and servers
      </li>
      <li>HTTP response codes, like 404: Not found, 500: Server error</li>
      <li>Difference between front- and back-end</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Learned a bit about HTML</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What is HTML = Hyper Text Markup Language</li>
      <li>What are HTML tags = headers, divisions, lists, paragraphs, etc.</li>
      <li>What are HTML attributes = type, name, size, lang, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Self-reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Web coding isn't new to me, I already took a course in the topic though it
      was a few months ago, so I will have to refresh the memories. I was and
      still unable to upload stuff to my google drive for some reasons, but will
      ask about it during next class, because I have this problem whenever I
      wanna access some links with my student account??? Excited about the next
      class's topic, because giving logic to pages, is what really interests me.
